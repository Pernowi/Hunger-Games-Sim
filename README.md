# Hunger-Games-Sim
"Simple" hunger games symulator in Python

Okay people. I translated this thing into 100% english, and added some comments. Names should be descriptive enough.

I think the best way to figure out how it works is to just sit down and read the code.
If you want to see, how it is working:
  1. Download and Install Python
  2. Download these files
  3. start it with 'python Symulation.py'
  
After that you should be able to read 'log1.txt' file that it produced.
